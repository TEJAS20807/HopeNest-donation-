    <h2><u>About Us</u></h2>
    <p><big>
      At HopeNest, we believe that no family should struggle for basic needs like food, shelter, education, and healthcare. Every day, thousands of families face hardships that can be eased with just a little support — and we are committed to being that helping hand.<br>
      We started our journey with a simple mission: to uplift poor and vulnerable families by providing them the resources they need to live with dignity. What began as a small initiative has now grown into a community-driven movement powered by compassion, kindness, and the belief that every act of giving creates a ripple of hope.
