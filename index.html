      “As any single mother, all I thought of was how I would provide for my children. With the second transfer, I bought iron sheets, a bicycle and clothes for my last born in secondary school. My greatest achievement so far has been paying school fees for my daughter. For the first time, I have paid it in full.”

      <p>
      “When I received the money, I invested Rs.800 into farming. Since I don’t have a farm land here, I asked a land owner for over a lot to plant cassava. I paid people to brush, clean, and plant. The rest of the money, I traveled to Village where I have a half lot with a foundation that stopped several years ago because I did not have the money to continue with the project.”
